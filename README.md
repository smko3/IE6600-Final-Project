# Air Quality In Beijing
## Overview 
Rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization are benefiting human beings in many ways, but they are also bringing about the inevitable problem of air pollution. Beijing, the capital of China, which has shown rapid economic growth in recent years, has been facing severe air pollution issues, with rising levels of PM2.5, a particularly harmful air pollutant, regularly exceeding the World Health Organization's recommended limit. To address this problem, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center has set up a network of monitoring stations across the city to measure air quality and provide data for policy makers and the public.

The dataset is the measurement and analysis of air quality in Beijing, China, over a period of four years. The dataset provides hourly measurements of six different air pollutants and several meteorological variables, which can be used to investigate patterns and trends in air quality and to identify sources of pollution. The goal of this project is to visualize various indicators related to air pollution in Beijing, and create a predictive time-series model through machine learning to raise awareness of air pollution issues and contribute to preventing potential contamination.

## Dataset Characteristics 
### Reference: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data# 
The datasets were originally from Guanghua School of Management at Peking University and are accessible in CSV format through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data comprises hourly readings of air pollutants at 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites between March 1st, 2013 and February 28th, 2017. Each CSV file contains 18 attributes that depict the varying concentrations of different pollutants per hour.
